# AI Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of fundamental Artificial Intelligence experiments demonstrating core problem-solving techniques, search strategies, optimization, and logical inference. Each experiment showcases how AI algorithms can be applied to structured problems and decision-making models.


## üìÅ Experiments Overview

### EXP 01: AI Agent
- **Description**: Introduction to the concept of intelligent agents, environments, percepts, and rational action selection. Demonstrates basic agent behavior models.

### EXP 02: Breadth First Search (BFS)
- **Description**: Implements the uninformed search algorithm BFS to explore nodes level-by-level. Useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### EXP 03: Dijkstra‚Äôs Shortest Path Algorithm
- **Description**: A uniform-cost search algorithm to compute the shortest path in a weighted graph, minimizing total traversal cost.

### EXP 04: A* Search on 2D Grid
- **Description**: Implements the heuristic-based A* search algorithm to find an optimal path between two points on a grid. Commonly used in navigation and robotics.

### EXP 05: Eight Queens Problem using Hill Climbing
- **Description**: Uses a local search technique (Hill Climbing) to place 8 queens on a chessboard such that none attack each other. Demonstrates optimization and heuristic evaluation.

### EXP 06: Sudoku Solver
- **Description**: Solves Sudoku puzzles using constraint satisfaction and smart search strategies such as backtracking with inference.

### EXP 07: Inferencing with Propositional Logic Sentences
- **Description**: Implements reasoning using propositional logic, inference rules, and truth evaluation to derive conclusions from logical statements.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3.x (recommended)
- **Libraries**: Standard Python libraries (`math`, `heapq`, etc.)
